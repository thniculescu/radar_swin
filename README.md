# Shifted-Window Transformer for Radar-Based Object Detection and Tracking

This project explores a **Shifted-Window Transformer modification for CenterNet/CenterTrack-type Object Detection and Tracking** from **FMCW radar point-clouds** for autonomous driving.  
The model is trained and tested on the **nuScenes dataset**.
